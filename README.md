# drumsep
A demonstration of a Convolutional Neural Network for drum signal separation from full mixes. 

For a quick demontration, do any of the following:
- watch this short video https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXTkHynMJmXa_CawrM5GT_Lk6eah4BbE/view?usp=sharing
- open up the evaluate.ipynb notebook with an IPython kernel and play the audio in the cell outputs
- run the network on your own recording by: 1. installing the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt` 2. run the program `python3 evaluate.py <song_path> <audio_output_path>
